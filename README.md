# React Redux minimal starter kit (boilerplate)

The framework for this project was originally forked from:

# Getting started

1. Once your environment is prepared, open a command prompt (terminal) and type in the following:

    ```sh
    cd C:\js\node\apps
    git clone https://github.com/catalin-luntraru/redux-minimal.git hello-world
    cd hello-world
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

2. Then open your [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the included small users app.
Congratulations! You can now write react redux code.

3. For more productivity you can install Chrome's [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
